# Spooky-Tweaks
This repository description is a work in progress!

Spooky Tweaks is a large scale vanilla overhaul mod aiming to 'funbalance' every issue in the entire game. That is to say, games are meant to be fun and enjoyable, even if that makes them slightly easier. This changes a lot of things, and MAY not be compatible with other tweaks.

This mod adds no *new* content! You can add and remove it at any time without destroying your saves. Please still make save backups to be safe.
