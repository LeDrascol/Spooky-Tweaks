# Spooky-Tweaks

Spooky Tweaks is a large scale vanilla overhaul mod aiming to 'funbalance' every issue in the entire game. That is to say, games are meant to be fun and enjoyable, even if that makes them slightly easier. This changes a lot of things, and MAY not be compatible with other tweaks.

This mod adds no __new__ content! You can add and remove it at any time without destroying your saves. Please remember to always make save backups when using mods.

This project is open source. You may create a fork that only contains certain features without needing to use the entire mod. It would be appreciated if these are called 'Spooky Modules', but you're free to name them whatever you would like.
