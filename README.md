# Spooky-Tweaks

Spooky Tweaks is a large scale vanilla overhaul mod that serves as an 'unofficial update' to the game. That is to say, it rebalances, fixes, streamlines, implements unused content, and reduces annoyance. While it attempts to be compatible with content mods, it may conflict with other vanilla-altering mods.

This mod adds no __new__ save-altering content! You can add and remove it at any time without destroying your saves, but remember to unstack items with increased stack sizes first. Please also remember to always make save backups when using mods.

This project is open source. You may create a modular fork if you only want a certain feature or small set of features. It would be appreciated if these are called 'Spooky Modules', but you have the freedom to do what you'd prefer.
