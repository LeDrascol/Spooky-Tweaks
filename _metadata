  "description" : "Spooky Tweaks is a large scale vanilla overhaul mod that serves as an 'unofficial update' to the game. That is to say, it rebalances, fixes, streamlines, implements unused content, and reduces annoyance. While it attempts to be compatible with content mods, it may conflict with other vanilla-altering mods.\n\nThis mod adds no save-altering content! You can add and remove it at any time without destroying your saves, but remember to unstack modified items. Always make save backups when using mods.\n\n[h1]Steam limits workshop items to 8,000 characters.
